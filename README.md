# CNN Implementation from Scratch

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main sections:

### Section 1: Convolutional and Pooling Layer from Scratch
In this section, I:
- Implement a basic convolutional layer and pooling layer from scratch in Python.
- Test these layers on a sample image to observe how convolution and pooling operations transform the image.

### Section 2: CNN on CIFAR-10 Dataset Using Keras
In this section, I:
- Use the Keras library to create a CNN model.
- Train and test the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Evaluate the performance of the CNN model using accuracy metrics.

## Dataset
The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) contains 60,000 images in 10 different classes: airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. Each class has 6,000 images, with a 50,000/10,000 split for training and testing.
